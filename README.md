# DimensionVisualization

This project is for the purpose in practicing the use of dimensionality reduction methods 
to visualize datasets.

Techniques that i wanted to look at are:

- PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- TSNE (T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
- UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)
- PyMDE (Python Minimum-Distortion Embedding)

## Installation

Installation is done with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) (although pip is
possible too for fallback purposes).

- run `poetry install`
- run `pre-commit install`
- optionally, add more packages using `poetry add <package>`
